# Index of the DMS 104 Deign Project Ideas

In each of the following "letters from the inventor" you'll find enough information to flex off of, so you can build your Marketing Requirements Document (MRD).  You may have to *read between the lines* - you may have to extrapolate a little, but for the most part you'll find hints so you can respond to each of the topics (the headings from Chapter 3) and embellish them with things that you come up with.  For instance, if the inventor gave you a list of features and said he needs you (the design team) to consider those features and help decide what's important, you can do that in the MRD. You can even offer some more ideas - just *spitballing* so to speak. There are other opportunities hinted in the letters for you to basically "sell yourself" (the design team) to the stakeholders.   

Also included are the original presentation slides (from you guys) that you can use to expound upon in your MRD, so long as nothing in your original ideas conflicts with what I wrote in the letters from the inventor.

*Remember: you're selling your design team to the stakeholders - you are <u>not</u> selling the product!*
