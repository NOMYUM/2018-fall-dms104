# Interactive Bench

Hello designers, 

I invented a device that I've tentatively called an "interactive bench" which looks like a normal type of bench except that it has built-in features that extends it, reshapes, and contorts itself into multiple variations of itself based on user input.  It can change from a simple bar-type of basic support to a Queen Anne style or even a lounge chaise.  There are also extensions that pop-out like variable arm rests, umbrellas, or desktops.  And to save space, it can also collapse into a small box when not in use.

There are other features, but I don't know which ones I should develop or which ones aren't really necessary.  I need you guys to help figure that out.  I can also improve the interface to control the features.  Commands can be selected from buttons or a touchscreen, typed or vocalized, or maybe I can rig-up hand gestures that can programmed to control features ...I don't know.  You tell me what's important, and I'll build it - whatever it takes!

As it is now however, the device is kinda clunky - doesn't look like much (just a bunch of slabs with a lot of things sticking out of it), and lots of wires coming out that connect to my laptop.  I use my laptop as the user interface.  Obviously, we can't sell it like that.  It needs your special skills to decide what exactly it should do, what it should look like, and how it should operate.  

I have an investor who believes he has an application where we can use this technology: in parks!  I can construct the device so its weather resistant and can be installed and operated on concrete or brick surfaces.  

There may be other applications - other environments where this product can be used.  If you come up with another, let me know.  I can re-tool the device larger or smaller, or add or drop features depending on the environment where it's used.  I need you guys to help me figure that out, and how to configure the interface and functionality that'll make this product very useful to the most people.  

The investor wants to target the parks & recreations market because he thinks he can sell it to the largest cities for use in public areas, for which we can charge a premium for these features.  That being said, whatever it takes - whatever the feature-set ends up needing to be, don't worry - I'll build it.  But on the other hand, because we don't have any competition, we need to be careful.  We don't want to rush to market either.  If we launch our product half-baked and it doesn't work as people expect it to work, that'll be worse than not launching it at all.  

Thanks and good luck!  I look forward to seeing your Marketing Requirements Document.
