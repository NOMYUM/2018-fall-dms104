# iMask

Hello designers, 

I invented a device that I've tentatively called "iMask" which looks like a type of headgear - like a space helmet - that fits over a person's head and provides services and environmental protection like temperature control, air filtration, and other factors that improves a person's ability to be comfortable in extreme environments whether they be hot, cold, or heavily polluted.  In addition to temperature control devices and air filtration in the helmet, I can add speakers (headphones), a mic, and even dispensers for aroma therapy.  

There can be a lot of other features, but I don't know which ones I should develop or which ones aren't really necessary.  I need you guys to help figure that out.  I can also improve the interface to control the features.  Commands can be typed on a connected device, or vocalized, or maybe I can rig-up "head gestures" that can programmed to control features ...I don't know.  You tell me what's important, and I'll build it - whatever it takes!

As it is now however, the device is kinda clunky - doesn't look like much (just a box with a lot of things sticking out of it), and lots of wires coming out that connect to my laptop.  I use my laptop as the user interface.  Obviously, we can't sell it like that.  It needs your special skills to decide what exactly it should do, what it should look like, and how it should operate.  

I have an investor who believes he has an application where we can use this technology: in heavily polluted cities!  I can construct the device so it fits comfortably for hours on one's shoulders and can be worn during commutes or any outdoor activity.  

There may be other applications - other environments where this product can be used.  If you come up with another, let me know.  I can re-tool the device larger or smaller, or add or drop features depending on the environment where it's used.  I need you guys to help me figure that out, and how to configure the interface and functionality that'll make this product very useful to the most people.  

The investor thinks the product will sell well if it's easy to use and looks fancy.  How exactly we do that is up to you guys.  The investor also thinks this product should be marketed toward the high-end user, i.e. people with a lot of disposable income.  From what I understand, there's a lot of money that can be made if we hit exactly the right feature-set and it has just the right look & feel. That being said, whatever it takes - whatever the feature-set ends up needing to be, don't worry - I'll build it.  But on the other hand, because we don't have any competition, we need to be careful.  We don't want to rush to market either.  If we launch our product half-baked and it doesn't work as people expect it to work, that'll be worse than not launching it at all.  

Thanks and good luck!  I look forward to seeing your Marketing Requirements Document.
