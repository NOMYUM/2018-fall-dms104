# Air Pillow

Hello designers, 

I invented a device that I've tentatively called "Air Pillow" which looks like a type of headgear - like a soft helmet - that fits over a person's head and provides support and environmental conditions like temperature control, music or white noise, and other factors that improves a person's ability to relax and/or sleep in environments that are not conducive for rest.  In addition to sensors and air filtration devices in the helmet, there are cushions and support pads that can dynamically adjust themselves to support the user's head in a comfortable position, and even reposition the user automatically for extended use situations.  

There are other features, but I don't know which ones I should develop or which ones aren't really necessary.  I need you guys to help figure that out.  I can also improve the interface to control the features.  Commands can be typed or vocalized, or maybe I can rig-up "head gestures" that can programmed to control features ...I don't know.  You tell me what's important, and I'll build it - whatever it takes!

As it is now however, the device is kinda clunky - doesn't look like much (just a box with a lot of things sticking out of it), and lots of wires coming out that connect to my laptop.  I use my laptop as the user interface.  Obviously, we can't sell it like that.  It needs your special skills to decide what exactly it should do, what it should look like, and how it should operate.  

I have an investor who believes he has an application where we can use this technology: on airplanes!  I can construct the device so it fits in the small space of an economy seat - perhaps even attaching to the headrest of the seat for stability.  

There may be other applications - other environments where this product can be used.  If you come up with another, let me know.  I can re-tool the device larger or smaller, or add or drop features depending on the environment where it's used.  I need you guys to help me figure that out, and how to configure the interface and functionality that'll make this product very useful to the most people.  

The investor wants to target the airline market because he thinks he can sell it to the largest largest airlines for use in first class, for which we can charge a premium for these features.  That being said, whatever it takes - whatever the feature-set ends up needing to be, don't worry - I'll build it.  But on the other hand, because we don't have any competition, we need to be careful.  We don't want to rush to market either.  If we launch our product half-baked and it doesn't work as people expect it to work, that'll be worse than not launching it at all.  

Thanks and good luck!  I look forward to seeing your Marketing Requirements Document.
