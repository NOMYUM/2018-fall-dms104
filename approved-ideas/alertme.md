Hello designers,

I've invented a device for my daughter who's attending college, to keep her safe.  It's a wearable  that has a number of features: it's part communication device; location tracker; breaking news notification device ...there's a long list of things it does, and I'm adding features all the time, but the features that seem to be working the best are:

- Call for help button that automatically calls security and tells them exactly where she is
- Call for assistance button that automatically summons a Lyft or Uber
- An ominous blue light which she can turn on and affix to her backpack or jacket which (I believe people might relate it to those blue boxes, and that might have an affect on would-be attackers)
- It also interfaces with her phone for some features through a custom app I built for it

There are other features, but I don't know which ones I should develop or which ones aren't really necessary.  I need you guys to help figure that out.  You tell me what's important, and I'll build it - whatever it takes!

Also, the device is kinda clunky - somewhat big and ugly.  And the associated phone app is not designed very well. Also the device itself has wires and antenna sticking out of it; I'm sure we can do better.

I have an investor that would like to help us develop the device into a saleable product.  He thinks the product will sell well if it's easy to use (both on the device and the app) and it needs to look trendy - not geeky.  How exactly we do that is up to you guys.  The investor also thinks this product should be marketed toward both high and low income students, perhaps segmenting the features as you guys see fit to make it both affordable or feature-rich, depending on what people can afford.  More than anything else, the investor - a real humanitarian - want's to make sure we can get this product in the hands of as many people who need it, as possible.

The investor is concerned about other products on the market that sort of does what our product does.  He wants us to get out there sooner rather than later, however it's important that whatever we launch with works perfectly!  Better to have fewer features that work well than more features that are faulty.  He's afraid that once a customer sees a feature that doesn't work as expected, they'll just stop using it.

Thanks and good luck!  I look forward to seeing your Marketing Requirements Document.
