# Interior Map Applications

Hello Designers,

I've invented a device: tentatively called the "interior map application".  It's an improvement on the idea of a mall map kiosk, but instead of just displaying static location information, it also provides other information including dynamic status on things including:

- Temperature and other environmental conditions
- Open areas (unused) and congested areas
- Event locations, scheduled and in real-time

It also provides static information like maps, but in an interactive way.  Users can query the interface to find certain paths to locations which may include options for accessibility.  

I can even interface the device with users' smartphones so they can carry updates - like walking directions - with them.

There are other features, but I don't know which ones I should develop or which ones aren't really necessary.  I need you guys to help figure that out.  I can also improve the interface to ask the queries.  It can be typed or vocalized, or maybe I can present a visual map that represents everything that's available, and the user can browse (as opposed to search) by scrolling through some kind of touch interface ...I don't know.  You tell me what's important, and I'll build it - whatever it takes!

As it is now however, the map device is kinda clunky, doesn't look like much (just a box with a lot of things sticking out of it), and lots of wires coming out that connect to my laptop.  I use my laptop as the user interface.  Obviously, we can't sell it like that.  It needs your special skills to decide what exactly it should do, what it should look like, and how it should operate.  

I have an investor who believes he has an application where we can use this technology: on college campuses, where buildings are old, and it's easy to get lost or confused when trying to get to classrooms or events.  On the device I can enable the touch interface to allow input so users can select what they're looking for and/or what their restrictions are (for accessibility), and the device can automatically highlight the path and even give a time estimate regarding how long it would take to get from point A to point B.  I can build-in all that and more but that's the rub: I don't know what the user wants.  I need you guys to help me figure that out, and how to configure the interface and functionality that'll make this product very useful to the most people.  

The investor wants to target this market because he thinks he can sell it to the largest largest universitiesfor which we can charge a premium for these features.  That being said, whatever it takes - whatever the feature-set ends up needing to be, don't worry - I'll build it.  But on the other hand, because we don't have any competition, we need to be careful.  We don't want to rush to market either.  If we launch our product half-baked and it doesn't work as people expect it to work, that'll be worse than not launching it at all.  

Thanks and good luck!  I look forward to seeing your Marketing Requirements Document.
