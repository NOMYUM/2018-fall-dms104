# Smart Bookshelf

Hello designers,

I've invented a device: tentatively called a "smart bookshelf."  Basically, it tracks what books you put on it and where.  It indexes lots of information about everything put on it.  Besides the title and other basic information, you can also add more information to the index yourself (e.g. "gift from Aunt Betty") and optionally let the bookshelf autonomously look up reference information on the Internet and add it to the index. (That feature would only work for some titles that are published widely.) Then, the bookshelf owner (the user) through an interface I built, can query the bookshelf: "where is 'Moby Dick'?" or "where is that book I got from Aunt Betty?" and the bookshelf will highlight the book's location using lights I've installed along the edges.  The user can also use queries like, "Do I have a book that explains the 'theory of relativity'?" or "randomly pick a science fiction book I haven't read lately."

There are other features, but I don't know which ones I should develop or which ones aren't really necessary.  I need you guys to help figure that out.  I can also improve the interface to ask the queries.  It can be typed or vocalized, or maybe a can present a visual map that represents everything in the database, and the user can browse (as opposed to search) by scrolling through some kind of touch interface ...I don't know.  You tell me what's important, and I'll build it - whatever it takes!

As it is now however, the bookshelf is kinda clunky, doesn't look like much (just a box with a lot of things sticking out of it), and lots of wires coming out that connect to my laptop.  I use my laptop as the user interface.  Obviously, we can't sell it like that.  It needs your special skills to decide what exactly it should do, what it should look like, and how it should operate.  

I have an investor who thinks the product will sell well if it's easy to use and looks fancy.  How exactly we do that is up to you guys.  The investor also thinks this product should be marketed toward the high-end user, i.e. people with a lot of disposable income.  From what I understand, there's a lot of money that can be made if we hit exactly the right feature-set and it has just the right look & feel.  

So regarding that look & feel, the investor really wants you to do whatever it takes, even if it means spending more money up front to get it right.  The investor says: money's no object when it comes to the design.  It's important that we do it right.  We don't want to rush to market with the wrong product.  

Thanks and good luck!  I look forward to seeing your Marketing Requirements Document.
