Hello designers,

I invented a type of wearable for my father that helps him live as independently as possible even though he's in decline, suffering from dementia.  It's part communication device, part reminder app, and it integrates with other devices I've installed around his home.  There's a long list of things it does, and I'm adding features all the time, but the features that seem to be working the best are:

- Walkie-talkie -like feature that he can use to contact me and my siblings quickly and easily (it's like a phone tree; first it tries to connect with me, but if I can't respond it goes to my sister, and then to my brother, et cetera, until someone can respond); and then he can talk to us through the device
- Pre-programmed reminders that I setup, that gives my father visual and audible reminders about things like when to take his meds - stuff like that
- Voice activated interface that lets him find things he lost, like keys or books; also he can pull-up a picture list of common things for when he can't remember the names of things; I have sensors all over his home that I setup to track things like that - and the system remembers! So he just asks the device and the system leads him to it

There are other features, but I don't know which ones I should develop or which ones aren't really necessary.  I need you guys to help figure that out.  You tell me what's important, and I'll build it - whatever it takes!

Also, the device and the equipment all over my father's home is kinda clunky.  The wearable is somewhat big and ugly - I'm not sure if that matters; and the sensors are big and bulky and has wires and antenna sticking out of them; I'm sure we can do better.

The investor thinks the product will sell well if it's easy to use (for both the elderly and the support-givers) and looks friendly, especially for the elderly.  How exactly we do that is up to you guys.  The investor also thinks this product should be marketed toward both high and low income people, perhaps segmenting the features as you guys see fit to make it both affordable or feature-rich, depending on what people can afford.  More than anything else, the investor - a real humanitarian - want's to make sure we can get this product in the hands of as many people who need it, as possible.

The investor is concerned about other products on the market that sort of does what our product does.  He wants us to get out there sooner rather than later, however it's important that whatever we launch with works perfectly!  Better to have fewer features that work well than more features that are faulty.  He's afraid that once a customer sees a feature that doesn't work as expected, they'll just stop using it.

Thanks and good luck!  I look forward to seeing your Marketing Requirements Document.
