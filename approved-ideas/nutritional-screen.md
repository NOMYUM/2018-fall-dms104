# Nutritional Screen

Hello designers,

I invented a special kind of glass that provides a type of heads-up display that can be pre-programmed to present information about things on the other side of the glass.  So a person (the user) could be standing on one side of the glass, and on the other side, sensors will recognize the presence and position of pre-determined objects, and then the glass will overlay information about those objects on the glass in a way that looks like the information is "floating" in-front of the objects from the point of view of the user.  I can even enable the glass with a touch interface to accept input from the user.  

The investor believes he has an application where we can use this technology: refrigerated glass cases in grocery stores.  A person should be able to see what's available (the glass can highlight items on the other side based on some kind of input from the user), and meta-information about anything on the shelf, like nutritional facts, serving sizes, anything on the label plus more.  I can enable the touch interface to allow input so users can select dietary restrictions and the glass can automatically highlight appropriate selections on the shelves - whatever the user wants.  And that's the rub: I don't know what the user wants.  I need you guys to help me figure that out, and how to configure the interface and functionality that'll make this product very useful to the most people.  

The investor wants to target this market because he thinks he can sell it to the largest grocery stores, like Wegmans, for which we can charge a premium for these features.  That being said, whatever it takes - whatever the feature-set ends up needing to be, don't worry - I'll build it.  But on the other hand, because we don't have any competition, we need to be careful.  We don't want to rush to market either.  If we launch our product half-baked and it doesn't work as people expect it to work, that'll be worse than not launching it at all.  

Thanks and good luck!  I look forward to seeing your Marketing Requirements Document.
