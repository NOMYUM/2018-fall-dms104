# Curl Temp

Hello designers, 

I invented a device that I've tentatively called "Curl Temp" which looks like a type of headgear - like a helmet - that fits over a person's hair and provides environmental conditions like humidity, temperature and other factors that improves the texture and style-ability of curly hair types.  Besides sensors in the device, there are dispensers with sprays that can apply various products.  I'm not exactly sure what I should build into it. I can build just about anything, but I need help on figuring out the best things to develop.

Also, I made the device so the user can input information about their hair types and things they want to improve, and the device does the rest.  As it is now however, it's kinda clunky, doesn't look like much (just a box with a lot of things sticking out of it), and lots of wires coming out that connect to my laptop.  I use my laptop as the controller.  Obviously, we can't sell it like that.  It needs your special skills to decide what exactly it should do, what it should look like, and how it should operate.  

The investor thinks the product will sell well if it's easy to use and looks fancy.  How exactly we do that is up to you guys.  The investor also thinks this product should be marketed toward the high-end user, i.e. people with a lot of disposable income.  From what I understand, there's a lot of money that can be made if we hit exactly the right feature-set and it has just the right look & feel.  

So regarding that look & feel, the investor really wants you to do whatever it takes, even if it means spending more money up front to get it right.  The investor says: money's no object when it comes to the design.  It's important that we do it right.  We don't want to rush to market with the wrong product.  

Thanks and good luck!  I look forward to seeing your Marketing Requirements Document.
