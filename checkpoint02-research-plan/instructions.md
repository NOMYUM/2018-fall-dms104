# Checkpoint 2: Research Plan

***Due: Wednesday, February 28, 2018 by 5:00 PM***<br>*Notice: it's due Wednesday so the professor can review your work and provide feedback at our next class on Thursday.*

This is a "checkpoint assignment."  This is a graded, team assignment.  

Note: this assignment is just the plan to do the research work.  You do not actually do the work yet (except for the focus group, which will start on Tuesday).

## Assignment 

Create a document that details a *research plan* that your city-team will use to gather information that will support the design of your product.

Typically, your **Team Lead** will work with their team to divvy up the responsibilities for writing this assignment among the team members.  

- The timeliness, formatting, completeness of the submission will reflect upon the Team Lead's grade.
- Everyone else will be graded equally based on the quality of the information in the document unless a team member falls short of expectations.  (Anyone should DM me in Slack as soon as you realize there may be an issue.)

Completion of this assignment assumes everyone in your team has studied Chapters 6, 7, and 9.  If part of your document appears to be written by someone who doesn't know the material, then that person *and the team lead* will lose points for this assignment.

### Formatting

The document needs to be formatted with the typical college stuff:

- **Cover information**: assignment name, date, your team name and the name and role of each person on your team
- **Text**: segment the information using meaningful headers.  Write the information using paragraphs, lists, whatever you need to communicate clearly.  And for god's sake, spell check!
- **Colophon**: on the last page, list who did what in support of the creation of this document.

### Content

In the document, report:

- Regarding the **interviews**: 
  - What are the **user roles** you've identified for your product; explain anything that needs to be explained about each role.  Who does what and why?  What are their data needs and relationships to each other?
  - In a perfect world (i.e. not college) how many of each role *should be* interviewed?  Also answer for each role: do you need to scale-up because it's a broad role?  Or scale-down because of other factors?  Explain.<br>*NOTE: regardless of what you should do, in the interest of time, each city-team will only need to do four interviews actually.*
  - Also report: what roles *will you actually* interview as part of your DMS 104 design project?  (Also, make sure you can reasonably find these people when you try to setup the interviews.)
  - **THE MOST IMPORTANT PART:** for each designer-role (IxD, VisD, and ID): what specific pieces of information do you need to get out of the interviews?  (Think in terms of your role in the design team.)  And as you answer that, what types of questions do you plan to ask to get that information? 

- Regarding all **other forms of research**:
  - What other type(s) of research makes sense for your product, and why?  (You need to pick *at least* one other research type - not counting focus groups because that's a given.)
  - Based on the other research you plan to do, explain any considerations you need to take into account.  Dependencies to be able to do the research?  Concerns?  Will you need help?  Money?  Explain.
  - Depending on what other research you plan to do, provide a simple plan (explanation) about how and when you plan to do it.

  Regarding **focus group** research: you do not have to say anything about that in this report.  That will be handled separately.

  ## Turn it in

  Although there is no length requirement to this assignment, you'll probably end-up with about two pages of text - maybe more, maybe less.  It doesn't matter so long as all the requirements of the document are fulfilled.

  Also keep in mind, this is a "checkpoint" assignment meaning this assignment doesn't carry a lot of weight in your overall grade for DMS 104.  However it's important to do this assignment so the professor can provide feedback to make sure you're on the right track when it matters.
