# DMS 104 Project 1: Marketing Requirements Document

*Due Date for the Document and Presentation Slides in Blackboard: Tuesday, February 13*<br>*Presentation day will be: Thursday, February 15*

This assignment, Project 1, is worth 5% of your overall grade for this course.  For this assignment, you will submit a document and presentation file as a team in Blackboard.  It gets one grade that gets shared equally among all four members in the team.  You will also deliver a presentation based on the document.  Whoever delivers the presentation gets extra credit.

The requirements for what goes into the *Marketing Requirements Document* (MRD) is explained in Chapter 3 of the book.  Focus on the MRD and "Determining Your Project's Parameters" part, not the *Project Plan* part.  

## The Concept Behind this Assignment

In the scenario where *the inventor and investor* of your idea meets the CEO of the design company for which you work, they informally discuss an idea for an interactive digital product, and they decide to move forward on it.  The CEO decides to use the resources of the designers (you guys) to work on the project.

The first step is to have the designers get the general idea from the inventor (played by the Professor on your behalf).  He and the investor are the **stakeholders** in this scenario.  They write a short letter about the idea and send it to the design team.  

Based on that letter, your first job as design team is to write a **Marketing Requirements Document** to basically restate what you think the inventor and the investor have in mind and make a presentation where they can ask questions.  So…

- Write the Marketing Requirements Document (MRD)
  - The structure and content of the MRD must answer the questions (the sections) to the best of your ability as described in Chapter 3 of the book (pages 35-39)
  - Depending on the project idea you're working with, some of the sections will be easier to answer than others, and some might make no sense.  Regardless, you must address all the sections and say *something* for each.
  - Remember: the document is *not* a sales brochure for the product.  You are "selling" yourselves as a design team - proving to the stakeholders that you understand what is being asked and you know what you're going to do, in as much detail as possible at this early stage.
  - Also, remember: you have not designed the product yet so don't describe the product!  Describe what it's supposed to do, address the ambiguities at this point (there should be many) and what your design challenge will be.
- Based on the content of your finished MRD, create an MRD presentation
  - The presentation slides should not contain anything that the document doesn't already say and vice versa.  
  - However, the slides should be a pared-down version of the verbiage from the document, using nothing but clips & phrases in the bullet points and visuals that add value only
  - Details behind the bulleted lists on the slides should appear in the speaker notes
  - On Thursday, one of the team members will deliver the presentation and be graded for it
- Submit the document and presentation file in Blackboard no later than *Tuesday, February 13*

# Hints & Tips

## The Document

The **Team Lead** should create a shared document (Google Docs seems to work very well for this purpose) and fill it out with the usual formal document parts and a basic outline.

The usual document parts include a title with a date …stuff like that.  You should also list everyone on the team and their role.

*Note: You will be graded on fundamental document formatting and presentation qualities, i.e. make it look nice and professional!*

Then the document should start with a general description of what you believe the stakeholders have in mind. You can echo their words right back to them, which is usually a good thing to prove that you were listening. And add a little more detail as you see fit.  

Then the rest of the document should follow the outline provided from the headings in the book, in the section: "Determining Your Project's Parameters."  Just write what you think the stakeholders wants to hear.  DO NOT use marketing *fluff words*.  Be specific in terms of the design process.  (You are designers - not marketing people!)

Suggestion for the **Team Lead**: set up the document and assign various parts to the team members.  In this case, it doesn't matter who does what.  You're all getting graded together as one.  

### Colophon

Also required: at the back of the document, there must be a section titled: "Colophon".  On that page, put a listing of all the team members and who did what, specifically, as part of this assignment.  Be as detailed as possible. 

- If there is a perceived disparity of effort within the team, any team member may DM the professor in Slack and voice their concerns.  The professor will maintain the team member's anonymity and assess the relative level of effort for each member when assigning grades.  Anyone who ends up doing more work than someone else will get the other person's grade added to their own as extra credit.

## The Presentation

After the document is nailed down, then the **presenter **(whoever you decide) needs to create a five-minute formal presentation based on the MRD and deliver it on Tuesday.   

- Be sure to follow the Rules for Formal Presentations.  
- The grade for the presenter will be extra credit, i.e. it can't hurt you

# Submissions in Blackboard

For the document: Blackboard has a group feature that allows anyone in a group to make a submission on the behalf of the group. Be careful!  You should decide in advance who's going to make the submission so there's no confusion.  (Typically, the Team Lead)

- The deadline is **Tuesday, February 13**
