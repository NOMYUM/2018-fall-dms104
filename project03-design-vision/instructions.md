# DMS 104: Project 3 - Design Vision

*Due: Tuesday, April 24, 2018*

This assignment, Project 3, is worth 15% of your overall grade for this course.  For this assignment, you will work on a document as a team in Blackboard but everyone will make a separate submission and be graded as an individual.

Think of the *Design Vision* as your book of rules that youâ€™ll use when you design the actual product in the next and final section of the course.  And remember, the rules you write must be related to information you pulled together in your U&DA document.

In our book, *Design for the Digital Age*, the Design Vision is described in terms of a presentation, but in DMS 104 you'll be putting together a document only. The document will summarize  data that your design team pulled together after the User and Domain Analysis based on the instruction from these chapters:  

- Framework (Chapters 14, 15, 16)
- Design Language (Chapters 17, 18)

The rubric for the Design Vision is in this document (below) wherever you see a bullet-point in the shape of a checkbox - that's something that'll be graded. 

## Document Structure

*Responsibility of the Team Lead...*

NOTE: the following sections are described in detail in Chapter 19, in the book, starting with *Crafting the Story* on page 517.  You can follow what's described in those pages keeping in mind: you are working on a much smaller project and you don't have to go into as much detail as they do in the book, especially
when the book refers to the number of slides - you're putting together a document for this deliverable, not a presentation.

- [ ] The document must follow **normal formatting practices** for college-level documents: proper headers, footers, typeface, line spacing, et cetera.  Poorly formatted documents, spelling mistakes, or anything that makes the document difficult to read will result in a reduced grade for the Team Lead.
- [ ] The document **must contain the sections** shown below IN THE ORDER SHOWN, clearly delineated with the following headings. The sub-bullets are shown here for your understanding only. (Do not include them in your document.)

## Sections

- [ ] Project Summary and Expectations (Team Lead)
      - This is where you re-introduce your product and what it will do. 

      - Here you can bring up ongoing concerns and issues (if any) that impact the design.

- [ ] Key Personas and Requirements (Team Lead)

  - This is a short re-statement of the personas and requirements you created from the U&DA
  - Do *not* just copy and paste all your personas and requirements from the U&DA; include only things from the U&DA that strongly influenced the Design Vision.

- [ ] Big Ideas and Major Anatomy (IxD and ID)

  - A.k.a. the *Interaction Framework* and *Industrial Design*
  - Focus on the interaction framework chosen (typical choices were listed in Chapter 15) and why. 
  - List data objects and functional needs (remember: nouns and verbs) and highlight where they come into play in the framework. (This comes mostly from the U&DA but the **Interactive Designer** needs to tie it together with their framework choices.) 
  - Introduce the Form Factor design requirements. (This would come from the **Industrial Designer**.)
  - Introduce the Interaction Design Anatomy.  Think of this section as wire frame interface(s) with general descriptions of each major part.  This would come from the **Interactive Designer**.
    - Remember to use unrealistic imagery. Wireframes, sketches, et cetera. You are writing rules for design, not the actual design itself.

- [ ] Scenario Storyboards (IxD)

  - This is, in effect, a visual and descriptive walk-through of the "play" the professor described during one of his lectures. (This would come from the **Interactive Designers**.)

  - Each walk-through is referred to as a "key path" - make sure you use the correct terminology as you write-up the scenario storyboards.  (Google: *storyboards* if you're unfamiliar with that term)

- [ ] How the Design Serves Persona Needs (VisD)

  - Make sure you tie the key paths back to each persona need.  Be specific, referring to the exact language used in the U&DA as much as possible.

- [ ] Design Language(s) (VisD and ID)

  - This section lists the design choices for theinterface and physical component(s) as defined by the **Visual Designer** and **Industrial Designer**.  (Remember the example document from *First Niagara Bank*.)

  - Remember: the design language is not the actual design of the product.  You can use example parts of the product in your design language but only where necessary so you can have something to show. Generally, it's better to simply list fonts, colors, shapes, et cetera AND (most importantly) what from the U&DA drove those decisions.

NOTE: not all sections described in the book are required.  You are only required to write-up the sections as shown above.

## Submission in Blackboard

Everyone needs to turn-in the same document in Blackboard (so you can be graded as an individual for the part you wrote.)

In our DMS 104 section, look in the Assignments area for "**Project 3: Design Vision**"

- *Recommended:* use a Google Doc and everyone just submits the same link in Blackboard.  Be sure the document is set to *Anyone Can View* else everyone will get a zero until it's fixed!
- If you use a format like Microsoft Word, just make sure everyone on your city-team has the *exact same* up-to-date version before you submit it in Blackboard.  Different versions will get a zero until the confusion is rectified.
