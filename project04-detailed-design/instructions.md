# DMS 104: Project 4 - Detailed Design

*Due: Friday, May 11, 2018 (end of exams week)*

This assignment, *Detailed Design* is described as the "Form and Behavior Specification" (F&BS) in chapter 24, and it accounts for 15% of your grade.  (The process is called "Detailed Design."  The document is called "Form & Behavior Specification.") 

For this assignment, you will work on a document as a team but everyone will make a separate submission and be graded as an individual in Blackboard.

The idea of the F&BS is that the design team would hand it off to an engineering team to create the product, and then engineering would hand it off to manufacturing to produce it for sale.  For DMS 104, we'll stop here at the end of the design process.  (Chapter 24.)

The recommended pieces and parts of what is supposed to be in a Form and Behavior Specification is the book (chapter 24), however, keep in mind that the book is written for large companies with lots of professional designers working full-time.  Also, you have to decide what makes sense for  *your* product design - not all the same type of tools makes sense for all products.  So for DMS 104 students: do the best you can...

- Render realistic drawings
- Create charts
- Use arrows on diagrams that explain things
- Provide explanations in short paragraphs or tables with steps and/or descriptions of things

...and as much as possible, **tie every aspect** back to your *Project 3: Design Vision*. 

See chapter 24 for lots of examples of various types of ways to represent product designs.  How exactly your team does that that, is up to you.  (Note: the professor will naturally tend to give higher grades to good looking, well rendered diagrams and illustrations, so do try!)

## Change Role in your City-team

For each of these major projects, you need to change roles: **IxD**, **VisD**, **ID**, **Team Lead**.  The professor isn't tracking who does what, when, but by the end of the semester, you need to have done each role one time.  If there was confusion about that, or if you're not on your forth role by now (Project 4) then contact the professor (via DM in Slack) to work something out.

## Document Structure

(*Responsibility of the Team Lead...*) Unlike the previous project-documents, the structure of the Form and Behavior Specification is based on the particulars of your product - so it'll be different for every city-team.  However, the document still needs to uphold standards:

- [ ] **Cover page:** a general (short – about one paragraph) introduction and perhaps an image (rendering) of the product
- [ ] There needs to be clear and **appropriately named section headers** that describe each section of the document
  - Hint: never write long paragraphs of text or many paragraphs one after another in any professional report.  Break up short concise paragraphs with lots of headings and sub-headings that describe them.


- [ ] The document must follow **normal formatting practices** for college-level documents: headers, footers, typeface, line spacing, et cetera.  Poorly formatted documents, spelling mistakes, or anything that makes the document difficult to read will result in a reduced grade for the Team Lead.

## Details

Every aspect of your team’s product design must be defined and presented in the the *F&BS.* It is your final deliverable for DMS 104.  

The Team Lead needs work with the rest of the team to figure-out the best way to structure the document and make sure there are full descriptions of your product in terms of:

- Its interface - every interaction (from the IxD)
- Its visual properties (from the VisD)
- Its physical properties (from the ID)

(Again, see chapter 24 for lots of examples of various types of ways to represent product designs.  

- [ ] (*Everyone's responsibility...*) Every aspect of each part of the final design must be clearly labeled and explained, not only in its function, but the rationale for why it exists.  (Note: if the professor thinks you're just making-up things, you'll lose points. Be sure to be specific regarding each design attribute.)

Anywhere in the document...
  - [ ] Descriptions of **interactions (states and steps)** will determine the IxD's grade
  - [ ] Descriptions of **visual properties** will determine the VisD's grade
  - [ ] Descriptions of **physical properties** will determine the ID's grade

## Submission in Blackboard

Everyone needs to turn-in the same document in Blackboard (so you can be graded as an individual for the part you wrote.)

In our DMS 104 section, look in the Assignments area for "**Project 4: Detailed Design**"

- *Recommended:* use a Google Doc and everyone just submits the same link in Blackboard.  Be sure the document is set to *Anyone Can View* else everyone will get a zero until it's fixed!
- If you use a format like Microsoft Word, just make sure everyone on your city-team has the *exact same* up-to-date version before you submit it in Blackboard.  Different versions will get a zero until the confusion is rectified.
